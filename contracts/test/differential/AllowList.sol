/// @notice The differences between the old contracts (`parent/`, the change's parent commit) and the source under
///         test that a change is allowed to make. A refactor's list stays empty (the plan's rule 3). Each change on
///         `contracts-audit-ready` replaces the list: the old side is its own parent, so the entries of earlier
///         changes no longer apply (T-356).
/// @dev How a change adds an entry: one `if` per difference, testing the exact difference (the action, the field,
///      and the values on both sides), never a whole field, with the change's ID and the reason beside it. An entry
///      returns `Verdict(change, diverged)`:
///      - `diverged = false`: the difference is confined to this step, or to fields the new side no longer has;
///        the comparison goes on. Use it for an event no longer emitted, or a refusal that leaves both sides in the
///        same shared state.
///      - `diverged = true`: the two sides now hold different shared state by design. The harness compares this
///        step's other fields, then stops comparing the seed and reports "diverged by <change> at step <n>".
///        `test_sideBySide_reachesEveryRow` fails when more than a quarter of its seeds diverge, so an entry cannot
///        quietly switch the gate off.
///
///      T-375, the removal of three money functions with no caller: no entry. The change must show no difference.
